// var: is a keyword used to tell javascript that what comes after is a variable.
// so x: is a variable
// the default value for any variable in javascript is undefined.

var age;

// How to initialize the variable?
// you just give it a value.

age = 30;

// if I want to define a variable and initialize it at the same time:
var x = 10;

// I can change the value whenever I want
x = 50;

x = 30;

// I can change the data type too.

x = "hello world!";
